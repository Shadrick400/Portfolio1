# 👋 Hi, I’m Shadrick Siame

I’m a student, software developer, and blockchain enthusiast with a strong interest in building systems from scratch and understanding how technology works at a deep level.

I enjoy working on projects that combine **software engineering, blockchain fundamentals, and web development**, with a focus on learning, experimentation, and real-world problem solving.
